Two versions
============
Both versions use command line arguments to set simulation parameters.

    1) GUI version
    --------------
        Requires Qt.
        Allows simulation control through buttons.
        Simulation layout (exits, fires) can be easily modified.

    2) console version
    ------------------
        To be used when Qt is not available.
        Simulation layout can be changed only through source file modification and rebuilding.
        Fires can only be generated in a random place (using the -X option)
        2 modes
            Default - Outputs just the initial state and final statistics.
            Visual  - Activated using -v option. Prints the whole grid in each simulation step.
